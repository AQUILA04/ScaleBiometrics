# Story 1.4: Distributed Observability

**Status:** Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps Engineer,
**I want** to configure tracing and logging,
**so that** I can debug across the distributed system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with `traceId`, `tenantId`.
2. **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration (Gateway -> Kafka -> DB).
3. **Metrics**: Prometheus endpoint exposed.

## Tasks
- [ ] Add Micrometer/OpenTelemetry dependencies.
- [ ] Configure Logback for JSON/MDC.
- [ ] Verify Trace ID propagation.

## Dev Notes
* Ensure MDC works with Virtual Threads.
